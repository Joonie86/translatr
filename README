translatr 0.2.0
by sephiroth99


__about translatr__
translatr is used to extract subtitles and localisation data from the Tomb
Raider games made by Crystal Dynamics (TRL, TRA, TRU, LCGoL). The translatable
text is saved to a file named "translations.xml", which can then be edited.

translatr is also used to patch back a modified "translations.xml". It will
create all the necessary patched files, which can then be used into the
game.


__how to use__
-=extract=-
translatr extract lang bigfile_path [be] [patch_path]

Arguments:
 lang        : language in-game language to extract
 bigfile_path: path to folder where bigfile.000 was extracted
 be          : (optional) write "be" to enable big endian extraction
 patch_path  : (optional) path to folder where patch.000 was extracted

The known supported languages by Tomb Raider are:
English (en), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Spanish (es),
Japanese (ja), Portugese (pt), Polish (pl), EnglishUK (uk), Russian (ru),
Czech (cs), Dutch (nl), Hungarian (hu)

-=apply=-
translatr apply translations_path [override_base_path [override_patch_path]]

Arguments:
 translations_path: path to modified translations.xml file
 override_base_path: (optional) path to extracted bigfile. Overrides path from xml.
 override_patch_path: (optional) path to extracted patch. Overrides path from xml.

This will create the new files in a folder named "newpatch". If a patch is
specified, all of its data will also be inserted in the output folder. This is
so that the patch can be easily rebuilt.
